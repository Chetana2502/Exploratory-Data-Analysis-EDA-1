Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset:

Overview:
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the data through statistics and visualizations. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including their age, sex, class, and whether they survived.

Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

Steps Performed:
1. Data Loading: Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas.
2. Summary Statistics: Generated summary statistics to understand the distribution of numeric features.
3. Visualizations:
   - Created histograms to visualize the distribution of ages.
   - Created boxplots to analyze the age distribution based on survival.
   - Used pairplots to visualize relationships between features.
   - Generated a correlation matrix to identify relationships between numeric features.
4. Missing Values: Checked for missing values in the dataset.
5. Survival Analysis: Analyzed the survival rates based on different features.

Insights
- The analysis revealed interesting patterns regarding the survival rates based on age, gender, and class.
- There were missing values in the dataset that may need to be addressed in further analysis.

Conclusion
This EDA provides a foundational understanding of the Titanic dataset, which can be used for further predictive modeling and analysis.

How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
2. Download the Titanic dataset and place it in the same directory as this notebook.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the analysis and visualizations.
